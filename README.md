# Twitch-Chat-Bot

This repository contains a bot module that connects to a Twitch Chat irc channel to read or store messages.
By reading and storing messages the bot can search for a specified phrase within messages or tally votes
from a specified library.  runBot.py starts the bot with command line interaction.

In order to run the bot successfully you will need to get a oauth Token from Twitch.  This can be easily found
in user settings on Twitch.tv.
